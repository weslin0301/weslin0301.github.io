Miss Flora M'Flimsey, of Madison Square,<br/>
Has made three separate journeys to Paris;<br/>
And her father assures me, each time she was there,<br/><br/>
That she and her friend, Mrs. Harris<br/>
(Not the lady whose name is so famous in history,<br/>
But plain Mrs. H., without romance or mystery),<br/>
Spent six consecutive weeks without stopping,<br/>
In one continuous round of shopping;<br/>
Shopping alone, and shopping together,<br/>
At all hours of the day, and in all sorts of weather;<br/>
For all manner of things that a woman can put<br/>
On the crown of her head or the sole of her foot,<br/>
Or wrap round her shoulders, or fit round her waist,<br/>
Or that can be sewed on, or pinned on, or laced,<br/>
Or tied on with a string, or stitched on with a bow,<br/>
In front or behind — above or below:<br/>
For bonnets, mantillas, capes, collars, and shawls;<br/>
Dresses for breakfasts, and dinners, and balls;<br/>
Dresses to sit in, and stand in, and walk in,<br/>
Dresses to dance in, and flirt in, and talk in;<br/>
Dresses in which to do nothing at all;<br/>
Dresses for winter, spring, summer, and fall,<br/>
All of them different in colour and pattern —<br/>
Silk, muslin, and lace, crape, velvet, and satin,<br/>
Brocade, and broadcloth, and other material<br/>
Quite as expensive and much more ethereal:<br/>
In short, for all things that could ever be thought of,<br/>
Or milliner, modiste, or tradesman be bought of,<br/>
From ten-thousand-francs robs to twenty-sous frills;<br/>
In all quarters of Paris, and to every store,<br/>
While M'Flimsey in vain stormed, scolded, and swore;<br/>
They footed the streets, and he footed the bills.<br/>
<br/>
The last trip, their goods shipped by the steamer Arago<br/>
Formed, M'Flimsey declares, the bulk of her cargo;<br/>
Not to mention a quantity kept from the rest,<br/>
Sufficient to fill the largest-sized chest,<br/>
Which did not appear on the ship's manifest,<br/>
But for which the ladies themselves manifested<br/>
Such particular interest, that they invested<br/>
Their own proper persons in layers and rows<br/>
Of muslins, embroideries, worked underclothes,<br/>
Gloves, handkerchiefs, scarfs, and such trifles as those.<br/>
Then, wrapped in great shawls, like Circassian beauties,<br/>
Gave GOOD-BYE to the ship, and GO-BY to the duties.<br/>
Her relations at home all marvell'd, no doubt,<br/>
Miss Flora had grown so enormously stout<br/>
For an actual belle and a possible bride;<br/>
But the miracle ceased when she turned inside out,<br/>
And the truth came to light, and the dry goods beside,<br/>
Which, in spite of collector and custom-house sentry,<br/>
Had entered the port without any entry.<br/>
And yet, though scarce three months have pass'd since the day<br/>
The merchandise went, on twelve carts, up Broadway,<br/>
This same Miss M'Flimsey, of Madison Square,<br/>
The last time we met, was in utter despair,<br/>
Because she had nothing whatever to wear!<br/>
NOTHING TO WEAR! Now, as this is a true ditty,<br/>
I do not assert — this, you know is between us —<br/>
That she's in a state of absolute nudity,<br/>
Like Powers' Greek Slave, or the Medici Venus;<br/>
But I do mean to say, I have heard her declare,<br/>
When, at the same moment, she had on a dress,<br/>
Which cost five hundred dollars, and not a cent less,<br/>
And jewelry worth ten times more, I should guess,<br/>
That she had not a thing in the wide world to wear!<br/>
I should mention just here, that out of Miss Flora's<br/>
Two hundred and fifty or sixty adorers,<br/>
I had just been selected as he who should throw all<br/>
The rest in the shade, by the gracious bestowal<br/>
On myself, after twenty or thirty rejections,<br/>
Of those fossil remains which she called 'her affections,'<br/>
And that rather decay'd, but well-known work of art,<br/>
Which Miss Flora persisted in styling 'her heart.'<br/>
So we were engaged. Our troth had been plighted,<br/>
Not by moonbeam or starbeam, by fountain or grove,<br/>
But in a front parlour, most brilliantly lighted,<br/>
Beneath the gas fixtures we whisper'd our love.<br/>
Without any romance, or raptures, or sighs,<br/>
Without any tears in Miss Flora's blue eyes;<br/>
Or blushes, or transports, or such silly actions,<br/>
It was one of the quietest business transactions;<br/>
With a very small sprinkling of sentiment, if any,<br/>
And a very large diamond imported by Tiffany.<br/>
On her virginal lips while I printed a kiss,<br/>
She exclaim'd, as a sort of parenthesis,<br/>
And by way of putting me quite at my ease,<br/>
'You know, I'm to polka as much as I please,<br/>
And flirt when I like — now stop, don't you speak — <br/>
And you must not come here more than twice in the week,<br/>
Or talk to me either at party or ball,<br/>
But always be ready to come when I call;<br/>
So don't prose to me about duty and stuff,<br/>
If we don't break this off, there will be time enough<br/>
For that sort of thing; but the bargain must be,<br/>
That, as long as I choose, I am perfectly free;<br/>
For this is a sort of engagement, you see,<br/>
Which is binding on you, but not binding on me.'<br/>
<br/>
Well, having thus woo'd Miss M'Flimsey and gain'd her,<br/>
With the silks, crinolines, and hoops that contained her,<br/>
I had, as I thought, a contingent remainder<br/>
At least in the property, and the best right<br/>
To appear as its escort by day and by night: <br/>
And it being the week of the STUCKUPS' grand ball —<br/>
Their cards had been out a fortnight or so,<br/>
And set all the Avenue on the tiptoe — <br/>
I consider'd it only my duty to call,<br/>
And see if Miss Flora intended to go.<br/>
I found her — as ladies are apt to be found, <br/>
When the time intervening between the first sound<br/>
Of the bell and the visitor's entry is shorter<br/>
Than usual — I found; I won't say, I caught her — <br/>
Intent on the pier-glass, undoubtedly meaning<br/>
To see if perhaps it didn't need cleaning.<br/>
She turned as I entered — 'Why, Harry, you sinner,<br/>
I thought that you went to the Flashers' to dinner!'<br/>
'So I did,' I replied, 'but the dinner is swallowed,<br/>
And digested, I trust, for 'tis now nine and more; <br/>
So being relieved from that duty, I followed<br/>
Inclination, which led me, you see, to your door. <br/>
And now will your ladyship so condescend<br/>
As just to inform me if you intend<br/>
Your duty and grace, and presence to lend<br/>
(All which, when I own, I hope no one will borrow)<br/>
To the STUCKUPS', whose party, you know, is to-morrow?'<br/>
The fair Flora look'd up with a pitiful air,<br/>
And answer'd quite promptly, 'Why, Harry, mon cher,<br/>
I should like above all things to go with you there;<br/>
But really and truly — I've nothing to wear!'<br/>
'Nothing to wear! Go just as you are;<br/>
Wear the dress you have on, and you'll be by far,<br/>
I engage, the most bright and particular star<br/>
On the Stuckup horizon.' I stopp'd, for her eye,<br/>
Notwithstanding this delicate onset of flattery,<br/>
Open'd on me at once a most terrible battery<br/>
Of scorn and amazement. She made no reply,<br/>
But gave a slight turn to the end of her nose<br/>
(That pure Grecian feature), as much as to say,<br/>
'How absurd that any sane man should suppose<br/>
That a lady would go to a ball in the clothes,<br/>
No matter how fine, that she wears every day!'<br/>
So I ventured again — 'Wear your crimson brocade,'<br/>
(Second turn-up of nose) — 'That's too dark by a shade.'<br/>
'Your blue silk' — 'That's too heavy;' 'Your pink' — 'That's <br/>too light.'<br/>
'Wear tulle over satin' — 'I can't endure white.'<br/>
'Your rose-coloured, then, the best of the batch' — <br/>
'I haven't a thread of point lace to match.'<br/>
'Your brown moiré antique' — 'Yes, and look like a Quaker;'<br/>
'The pearl-coloured' — 'I would, but that plaguy dressmaker<br/>
Has had it a week.' 'Then that exquisite lilac,<br/>
In which you would melt the heart of a Shylock'<br/>
(Here the nose took again the same elevation)<br/>
'I wouldn't wear that for the whole of creation.'<br/>
'Why not? It's my fancy, there's nothing could strike it<br/>
As more comme il faut —' 'Yes, but, dear me, that lean<br/>
Sophronia Stuckup has got one just like it,<br/>
And I won't appear dress'd like a chit of sixteen.'<br/>
'Then that splendid purple, that sweet Mazarine; <br/>
That superb point d'aiguille, that imperial green,<br/>
That zephyr-like tarlatan, that rich grenadine' — <br/>
'Not one of all which is fit to be seen,'<br/>
Said the lady, becoming excited and flush'd.<br/>
'Then wear,' I exclaimed, in a tone which quite crush'd<br/>
Opposition, 'that gorgeous toilette which you sported<br/>
In Paris last spring, at the grand presentation,<br/>
When you quite turn'd the head of the head of the nation;<br/>
And by all the grand court were so very much courted.'<br/>
The end of the nose was portentously tipped up<br/>
And both the bright eyes shot forth indignation,<br/>
As she burst upon me with the fierce exclamation,<br/>
'I have worn it three times at the least calculation,<br/>
And that and the most of my dresses are ripped up!'<br/>
Here I ripp'd OUT something, perhaps rather rash,<br/>
Quite innocent, though; but to use an expression<br/>
More striking than classic, it 'settled my hash,'<br/>
And proved very soon the last act of our session.<br/>
'Fiddlesticks, is it, sir? I wonder the ceiling<br/>
Doesn't fall down and crush you. Oh, you men have no feeling!<br/>
You selfish, unnatural, illiberal creatures!<br/>
Who set yourselves up as patterns and preachers.<br/>
Your silly pretence — why, what a mere guess it is!<br/>
Pray, what do you know of a woman's necessities?<br/>
I have told you and shown you I've nothing to wear,<br/>
And it's perfectly plain you not only don't care,<br/>
But you do not believe me' (here the nose went still higher).<br/>
'I suppose if you dared you would call me a liar.<br/>
Our engagement is ended, sir — yes, on the spot;<br/>
You're a brute, and a monster, and — I don't know what.'<br/>
I mildly suggested the words — Hottentot,<br/>
Pickpocket and cannibal, Tartar and thief,<br/>
As gentle expletives which might give relief.<br/>
But this only proved as a spark to the powder,<br/>
And the storm I had raised came faster and louder;<br/>
It blew and it rain'd, thunder'd, lighten'd, and hail'd<br/>
Interjections, verbs, pronouns, till language quite fail'd<br/>
To express the abusive; and then its arrears<br/>
Were brought up all at once by a torrent of tears;<br/>
And my last faint, despairing attempt at an obs-<br/>
Ervation was lost in a tempest of sobs.<br/>
Well, I felt for the lady, and felt for my hat, too.<br/>
Improvised on the crown of the latter a tattoo,<br/>
In lieu of expressing the feelings which lay<br/>
Quite too deep for words, as Wordsworth would say.<br/>
Then, without going through the form of a bow,<br/>
Found myself in the entry — I hardly knew how —<br/>
On door-step and side walk, past lamp-post and square,<br/>
At home and upstairs, in my own easy chair;<br/>
Poked my feet into slippers, my fire into blaze,<br/>
And said to myself, as I lit my cigar,<br/>
Supposing a man had the wealth of the Czar<br/>
Of the Russias to boot, for the rest of his days,<br/>
On the whole, do you think he would have much to spare,<br/>
If he married a woman with nothing to wear?<br/>
<br/>
Since that night, taking pains that it should not be bruited<br/>
Abroad in society, I've instituted<br/>
A course of inquiry, extensive and thorough,<br/>
On this vital subject; and find to my horror,<br/>
That the fair Flora's case is by no means surprising,<br/>
But that there exists the greatest distress<br/>
In our female community, solely arising<br/>
From this unsupplied destitution of dress,<br/>
Whose unfortunate victims are filling the air<br/>
With the pitiful wail of 'Nothing to wear.'<br/>
Researches in some of the 'Upper Ten' districts<br/>
Reveal the most painful and startling statistics,<br/>
Of which let me mention only a few:<br/>
In one single house, on the Fifth Avenue,<br/>
Three young ladies were found, all below twenty-two,<br/>
Who have been three whole weeks without anything new<br/>
In the way of flounced silks, and thus left in the lurch,<br/>
Are unable to go to ball, concert, or church.<br/>
In another large mansion near the same place,<br/>
Was found a deplorable, heart-rending case<br/>
Of entire destitution of Brussels point lace.<br/>
In a neighbouring block there was found, in three calls,<br/>
Total want, long-continued, of camels'-hair shawls;<br/>
And a suffering family, whose case exhibits<br/>
The most pressing need of real ermine tippets;<br/>
One deserving young lady almost unable<br/>
To survive for the want of a new Russian sable;<br/>
Still another, whose tortures have been most terrific<br/>
Ever since the sad loss of the steamer PACIFIC;<br/>
In which were engulfed, not friend or relation<br/>
(For whose fate she perhaps might have found consolation,<br/>
Or borne it, at least, with serene resignation),<br/>
But the choicest assortment of French sleeves and collars<br/>
Ever sent out from Paris, worth thousands of dollars;<br/>
And all, as to style, most recherché and rare,<br/>
The want of which leaves her with nothing to wear,<br/>
And renders her life so drear and dyspeptic,<br/>
That she's quite a recluse, and almost a sceptic;<br/>
For she touchingly says that this sort of grief<br/>
Cannot find in Religion the slightest relief,<br/>
And Philosophy has not a maxim to spare<br/>
For victims of such overwhelming despair.<br/>
But the saddest by far of all these sad features<br/>
Is the cruelty practised upon the poor creatures<br/>
By husbands and fathers, real Bluebeards and Timons,<br/>
Who resist the most touching appeals made for diamonds<br/>
By their wives and their daughters, and leave them for days<br/>
Unsupplied with new jewelry, fans, or bouquets;<br/>
Even laugh at their miseries whenever they have a chance,<br/>
And deride their demands as useless extravagance.<br/>
One case of a bride was brought to my view,<br/>
Too sad for belief, but, alas! 't was too true,<br/>
Whose husband refused, as savage as Charon,<br/>
To permit her to take more than ten trunks to Sharon.<br/>
The consequence was, that when she got there,<br/>
At the end of three weeks she had nothing to wear;<br/>
And when she proposed to finish the season<br/>
At Newport, the monster refused out and out,<br/>
For his infamous conduct alleging no reason,<br/>
Except that the waters were good for his gout. <br/>
Such treatment as this was too shocking, of course,<br/>
And proceedings are now going on for divorce.<br/>
But why harrow the feelings by lifting the curtain<br/>
From these scenes of woe! Enough, it is certain,<br/>
Has here been disclosed to stir up the pity<br/>
Of every benevolent heart in the city,<br/>
And spur up humanity into a canter<br/>
To rush and relieve these sad cases instanter.<br/>
Won't somebody, moved by this touching description,<br/>
Come forward to-morrow and head a subscription?<br/>
Won't some kind philanthropist, seeing that aid is<br/>
So needed at once by these indigent ladies,<br/>
Take charge of the matter? Or won't PETER COOPER,<br/>
The corner-stone lay of some splendid super-<br/>
Structure, like that which to-day links his name<br/>
In the Union unending of honour and fame;<br/>
And found a new charity just for the care<br/>
Of these unhappy women with nothing to wear;<br/>
Which, in view of the cash which would daily be claim'd,<br/>
The Laying-out Hospital well might be named?<br/>
Won't STEWART, or some of our dry-goods importers,<br/>
Take a contract for clothing our wives and our daughters?<br/>
Or, to furnish the cash to supply those distresses,<br/>
And life's pathway strew with shawls, collars, and dresses,<br/>
Ere the want of them makes it much rougher and thornier,<br/>
Won't some one discover a new California?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, ladies, dear ladies, the next sunny day<br/>
Please trundle your hoops just out of Broadway,<br/>
From its whirl and its bustle, its fashion and pride,<br/>
And the temples of Trade which tower on each side,<br/>
To the alleys and lanes, where Misfortune and Guilt<br/>
Their children have gather'd, their city have built;<br/>
Where Hunger and Vice, like twin beasts of prey,<br/>
Have hunted their victims to gloom and despair;<br/>
Raise the rich, dainty dress, and the fine broider'd skirt,<br/>
Pick your delicate way through the dampness and dirt,<br/>
Grope through the dark dens, climb the rickety stair<br/>
To the garret, where wretches, the young and the old,<br/>
Half-starved and half-naked, lie crouch'd from the cold.<br/>
See those skeleton limbs, those frost-bitten feet,<br/>
All bleeding and bruised by the stones of the street;<br/>
Hear the sharp cry of childhood, the deep groans that swell<br/>
From the poor dying creature who writhes on the floor;<br/>
Hear the curses that sound like the echoes of Hell,<br/>
As you sicken and shudder, and fly from the door!<br/>
Then home to your wardrobes, and say — if you dare —<br/>
Spoil'd Children of Fashion — you've nothing to wear!<br/>
<br/>
And Oh, if perchance there should be a sphere,<br/>
Where all is made right which so puzzles us here,<br/>
Where the glare and the glitter, and tinsel of Time<br/>
Fade and die in the light of that region sublime,<br/>
Where the soul, disenchanted of flesh and of sense,<br/>
Unscreen'd by its trappings, and shows, and pretence,<br/>
Must be clothed for the life and the service above<br/>
With purity, truth, faith, meekness, and love;<br/>
Oh, daughters of Earth! foolish virgins, beware!<br/>
Lest in that upper realm you have nothing to wear!<br/>
