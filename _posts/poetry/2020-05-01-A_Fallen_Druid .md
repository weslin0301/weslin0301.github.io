Alone in thoughts her thawing hands were cold <br/>
Composed fantastic care and mortal fears <br/>
Appraise not aged minds the sincere soul <br/>
That shrines innumurous times torrential tears   <br/>
<br/>
By peons whose hungry pride polluted food <br/>
That tied the mind to knots the knowledge froze <br/>
Live not for reason reaped from seeds falsehood  <br/>
To find the final feast and fare for toll  <br/>
<br/>
Not turned to tamed content of cunning maids <br/>
Or God with simple seamstress fascinates <br/>
Then bide and bind by those enchantment days <br/>
Await assured the freeing fate of faith  <br/>
<br/>
The law of Rome may lord the humble tomes <br/>
A month or year or century lasts and dies <br/>
But truth and true despair transcend the bones <br/>
A day has gone by days shall this law bide <br/>
<br/>
