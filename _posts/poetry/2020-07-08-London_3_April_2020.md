## London, 3 April 2020

Earlier today, the tranquil looking wisps<br/>
Of clouds seemed so close to the silent earth.<br/>
I bought the home some hellebores and wished<br/>
It barricades evil, protects the herd.<br/>
<br/>

## Tea time

(written on 26 April 2020)<br/>
On a lovely day to pray and read<br/>
Market opens rushed in seven seas<br/>
In a cup of tea's time we should see<br/>
How insanely crowded it could be<br/>
<br/>

## Diablo Immortal at Blizzcon 2018

(written on 25 May)<br/>
The fans of the PC game Diablo<br/>
Disparaged the mobile Immortal<br/>
“Guys, don’t you have phones though?”<br/>
Like, don’t you have buttholes? –<br/>
Indeed, but we Don’t like the anal! <br/>
<br/>

## Proud man

(written in early June 2020)<br/>
Smoothen the creases of the day<br/>
Grease of my hair too washed away <br/>
Conflict of countries, fire and dusk<br/>
Rules that made sense, to fade or rust<br/>
<br/>
Who gives the poor man an escape<br/>
Greater than pain, or compensates<br/>
Dying for blood thirst? By affront<br/>
Stirring, the proud man blunders on<br/>
<br/>

## The Temple bell

(written on 8 July 2020)<br/>
The edge of the world, a time of crisis,<br/>
A good leader follows, heaven or hell;<br/>
A bad leader runs a rudderless ship. <br/>
Do we need leaders to sound solemn knells?<br/>
We are our own leaders from fairytales...<br/>
The sound of the ominous Temple bell.<br/>
<br/>
