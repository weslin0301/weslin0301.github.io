News the board for legal training<br/>
Planned to cancel written screening<br/>
Boosting numbers was the aim<br/>
Fair to races known as BAME<br/>
<br/>
When I read this fun report<br/>
Felt the sarcasm and more<br/>
Black and Asian aren't the same<br/>
Foreign students mute at BAME<br/>
<br/>
Context can this term acquire?<br/>
Shouldn't Merit but inspire<br/>
Youths that worthy, sound and sane?<br/>
Double barrel sanctions BAME<br/>
<br/>
Reading's hard as much as writing<br/>
Can we cancel that too lightly?<br/>
When good competition reigns<br/>
Proper lawyers will have BAME<br/>
<br/>
Call it BAME when people died<br/>
From the plaguy virus fight<br/>
Let society know the pains<br/>
And the courage of the BAME<br/>
<br/>
This assessment as debated<br/>
Cash or class always related<br/>
Law exams as well made plain<br/>
Fairness shouldn't flag the BAME <br/>
<br/>
