Times are times' totalities<br/>
Beauty of life and more are found<br/>
Time may bring serenity<br/>
But it never lingers on<br/>
<br/>
I can see the childhood soul<br/>
And the grown-up's life<br/>
All the time remember those<br/>
Far away or died<br/>
<br/>
I can see the happy times<br/>
News that thrilled my heart<br/>
Not forgetting all the sighs<br/>
Pains forever last<br/>
<br/>
When my time is passed away<br/>
Time will go on ever<br/>
Time shall flourish every way<br/>
Then it finds me never<br/>
<br/>
